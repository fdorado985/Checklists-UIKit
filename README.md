## Description

The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once you’ve completed them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

## To-Do List Programming

* [x] Put a table view on the app’s screen.
* [x] Put data into that table view.
* [x] Allow the user to tap a row in the table to toggle a checkmark on and off.
* [x] Add a navigation controller to Checklists to allow navigation between screens and add a button to the navigation bar to allow adding new items.
* [x] Add the ability to delete rows from a list of items presented via a table view.
* [x] Create a new screen from which you can (eventually) add new to-do items.
* [ ] Add a static table view cell to the table to display the text field for data entry.
* [ ] Access the contents of the text field.
* [ ] Improve the look and functionality of the Add Item screen.
