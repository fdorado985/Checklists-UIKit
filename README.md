## Description

The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once you’ve completed them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

## To-Do List Programming

* [x] Put a table view on the app’s screen.
* [ ] Put data into that table view.
* [ ] Allow the user to tap a row in the table to toggle a checkmark on and off.
