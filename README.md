## Description

The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once you’ve completed them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.

## To-Do List Programming

* [x] Put a table view on the app’s screen.
* [x] Put data into that table view.
* [x] Allow the user to tap a row in the table to toggle a checkmark on and off.
* [x] Add a navigation controller to Checklists to allow navigation between screens and add a button to the navigation bar to allow adding new items.
* [x] Add the ability to delete rows from a list of items presented via a table view.
* [x] Create a new screen from which you can (eventually) add new to-do items.
* [x] Add a static table view cell to the table to display the text field for data entry.
* [x] Access the contents of the text field.
* [x] Improve the look and functionality of the Add Item screen.
* [x] Edit existing to-do items via the app interface.
* [x] Using Xcode’s built-in refactoring capability to rename code to be easily identifiable.
* [x] Fix missed code changes after the code refactoring using the Find navigator.
* [x] A quick look at why you need data persistence.
* [x] Determine where in the file system you can place the file that will store the to-do list items.
* [x] Save the to-do items to a file whenever the user makes a change such as: add a new item, toggle a checkmark, delete an item, etc.
* [x] Load the to-do items from the saved file when the app starts up again after termination.
* [x] Add a new view controller to show all the lists of to-do items.
* [x] Complete the user interface for the All Lists screen.
* [x] Display the to-do items for a selected list from the All Lists
screen.
* [x] Add a view controller to add/edit checklists.
* [x] Update the data model so that the to-do items for a list are saved along with the list.
* [x] Add some fake data to test that the new changes work correctly.
* [x] Change your data saving strategy so that your data is only saved when the app is paused or terminated, not each time a change is made.
* [x] Hand over data saving/loading to the data model itself.
* [x] Improve the user-experience by remembering the last open list on app re-launch.
* [x] Adding in checks to guard against possible crashes — coding defensively instead of reacting to crashes later.
* [x] Improving the first-run experience for the user so that the app looks more polished and user-friendly.
* [x] Show the number of to-do items remaining for each list.
* [x] Sort the list of checklist items alphabetically.
* [x] Add the ability to specify a helpful icon for each list item to indicate what the list is about.
* [x] Improve how the app looks by making a few basic colour changes to give it its own unique style.
* [ ] Try out a local notification just to see how it works.
* [ ] Allow the user to pick a due date for to-do items.
* [ ] Create a date picker control.
* [ ] Schedule local notifications for the to-do items, and update them when the user changes the due date.
